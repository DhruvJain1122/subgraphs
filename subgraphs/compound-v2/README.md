### TODO

- add calculations for daily snapshots
- Figure out how/where to calculate/update:
  - market.rewardTokenEmissionsAmount
  - market.rewardTokenEmissionsUSD
  - marketDailySnapshot.rewardTokenEmissionsAmount
  - marketDailySnapshot.rewardTokenEmissionsUSD
  - financialDailySnapshot.supplySideRevenueUSD
  - financialDailySnapshot.protocolSideRevenueUSD
  - financialDailySnapshot.feesUSD
- Test along the way
- test making sure each var is what we want
- test along dune tests to ensure accuracy
- Refactor code - make sure all standards are followed
